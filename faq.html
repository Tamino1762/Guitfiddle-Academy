            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div id="faq" name="faq">
                <h4>Who are you?</h4>
                <p>I am Theresa Bollhagen, and the name of my teaching studio is Guitfiddle Academy. I majored in guitar and violin at Milwaukee Area Technical Collge, and majored in violin and viola at Carroll University. I have been teaching for over 17 years, and inside Wondersound Music for 15 of those years.</p>
                <h4>How long of a lesson should my child/I take?</h4>
                <p>Generally a 30 minute lesson/week is just fine, but as students progress to more challenging material, a 60 minute lesson may be desired.</p>
                <h4>What else do I need to consider?</h4>
                <p>This is a big question! First, remember that there is a daily time commitment when learning any instrument. In order to make the most out of lessons, there should be daily practice. Also remember that young children, for the most part, do not practice on thier own. They will need help and reminders from parents/guardians. Also, in addition to the instrument and book, the student will need a music stand, and a tuner will also be helpful. Guitar straps are a must for guitar players. Electric guitar players will also need an amplifier and must use it for practice.</p>
                <h4>What should I bring to my first lesson?</h4>
                <p>You should bring your instrument, book or current piece/song, and your enthusiasm. Amplifiers are provided.</p>
                <h4>Will you come to my house?</h4>
                <p>I'm sorry, but I do not make house calls. They are time consuming for me and distracting for the student.</p>
                <h4>Can I buy or rent an instrument from you? What are your rental rates?</h4>
                <p>I personally do not sell or rent instruments, however, they are still available in house at <a href="https://www.wondersoundmusic.com/" target="_blank">Wondersound Music</a>. Please contact Wondersound for current rental rates and packages.</p>
                <h4>Can I take lessons every other week?</h4>
                <p>I do not teach lessons only every other week. This is because learning progression is very slow and frustrating for the student, and it will leave a bi-weekly time slot open that no one will want.</p>
                <h4>Can I take a free trial lesson?</h4>
                <p>I would be happy to chat with you via phone, Skype, or Discord. If you would like an actual lesson, you will be charged for one lesson.</p>
                <h4>Should I buy an electric or acoustic guitar?</h4>
                <p>Generally speaking, it makes no difference which type of guitar you start out with. For economical reasons, most start with an acoustic guitar because there's no added expense of an amplifier.</p>
                <h4>Is it a good idea to buy an instrument from the internet?</h4>
                <p>For the most part, no. Unless the instrument is from a reputable brick and mortar retailer's website, buying an instrument from the net is usually a bad idea. The prices are attractive at first, but to make them playable for learning will end up costing you more in the long run. For the most part, you can't try it before you buy it either.

                <h4>Who designed your cool website?</h4>
                <p>Why, I designed it and coded it myself! I am currently a Web and Software Development student at Waukesha County Technical College.</p>
